# ZimaDB
SQLite-like database implementation from scratch (semestral project by Petr Chmel and Vil√©m Zouhar).

## Documentation
Read concept assignment in `doc/concept.md`.

## Build
`make zimadb`

We use makefile with a simple cascade:
`zimadb` requires all of the source files to be compiled as well as `libzimadbe.a`, located in `engine/`. This folder contains its own makefile with `engine` target, which requires all of this folders source files to be compiled. The product is `engine/bin/libzimadbe.a` which is linked back with the rest of top level zimadb objects.
